# JPG and RAW Synchronizer

Welcome to the JPG and RAW Synchronizer project! This tool is designed to synchronize JPG and RAW files automatically. It scans a directory for JPG files, matches them with corresponding RAW files, and copies them to a specified output directory.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jpg-raw-synchronizer.git
Install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install tkinter
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd jpg-raw-synchronizer
Run the main.py script:

```bash
python main.py
Input the paths to the directories containing JPG and RAW files, as well as the output directory where RAW files will be copied.

Click the "Run" button to start the synchronization process.

Note
If there are JPG files without corresponding RAW files, a file named no_raw_version.txt will be created listing the JPG files without RAW versions.
